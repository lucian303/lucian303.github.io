<p>You know the 5 minute scrum meeting that turns into a 15 minute standup that turns into a half an hour meeting held every day, sometimes just for the sake of it being held? That robs the energy of the whole morning. A whole productive morning of coding gone while waiting and checking email and doing all sorts of other inane things while you wait to speak your two sentences. </p>
<p>Scrum is for rugby.</p>
<p>Email is for updates.</p>
