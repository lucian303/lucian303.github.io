<p>I feel something deep in the pit of my stomach as if I had just woken up with an extreme hangover. A pounding headache starts to pulsate from the back of my skull getting stronger and stronger. First the&nbsp;dizziness&nbsp;and then the double vision. I can feel vomit in my throat and I struggle to keep it down. Losing my balance, I just can't take it any more and ...</p>
<p>... WAIT! I realize I'm in an interview talking to a prospective employer or contractee. I'm not hung over. And I'm not physically sick.</p>
<p>Yet I am. What makes people want to rewrite the wheel for the n<sup>th</sup> time? Then the "reasons" come:</p>
<p>"We wanted to fully understand what was going on in our code." -- Why because you have a bunch of stupid monkeys who can't read code?</p>
<p>"We wanted control." -- Ah retarded control freaks. Wonderful!</p>
<p>"We have a really smart and schooled guy who created this specifically for our needs." -- Oh you mean he or she is smarter than the thousands of people contributing thousands of hours for free in the open source community? Oh wait, he's just a&nbsp;brazen egomaniac. Do you even know your needs?</p>
<p>I thought that as engineers, we were supposed to be logical.</p>
<p>"<em>I think that reinventing the wheel is silly ... It is a sign of the immaturity of our field that people resists adopting more advanced tools and prefer to spend their energies reinventing things using primitive tools rather than taking the time to learn more powerful ones.</em>" --&nbsp;Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++ (<a title='Interview of Bjarne Stroustrup by "Developpeur Reference"' href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/nantes-interview-english.html" target="_blank">http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/nantes-interview-english.html</a>)</p>
<p>I've been programming for about 17 years, the last 6 or so doing web development using PHP and JS as server and client side languages respectively. Back in the days when I used to program in C or C++, even QBasic, I had little&nbsp;communication&nbsp;with the outside world. A few books with highly treasured floppies or perhaps even a CD-ROM! Then I finally got internet access, and I was almost overwhelmed. The treasure I had been seeking out was not so elusive, so expensive, so mysterious as it once had been. In fact, it was free and quite readily available.</p>
<p>I had found more code! Tons of it. Other people's code. Now, I know that last phrase scares the shit out of many mediocre (at best) code monkeys. At times, I too have been wary of approaching and using other people's code. And this is not a bad attitude per se. Just like meeting other people, we have to be careful, be on guard, have a little skepticism. We have to judge others just as we judge others' code. After all, there's a ton of bad people out there and even more bad code.</p>
<p>Then again, there are a ton of better developers out there than me, many of which are writing this code and giving it away for free.</p>
<p>We're talking about tried and true frameworks a.k.a. libraries. Things like <a title="Zend Framework" href="http://zendframework.com/" target="_blank">Zend Framework</a> and <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>. Code that has been used in large, professional applications and has prevailed in the real world, in real-world apps. Code that is backed by a community--a community of people who care enough about it to spend their spare time, without compensation, creating, maintaining, and improving the code. Not just the code either. Documentation, tests, email lists, forums, etc.</p>
<p>"Beg, borrow, or steal before rewriting your own code." These are wise words from someone I respect very much. Each application, before being started has to be evaluated for its requirements and the best tools need to be chosen to complete it. Most web applications are really not all that different and implement commonly used patterns such as MVC. In 99.999% of cases, a web app is not that unique that it needs to be rewritten from the ground up.</p>
<p>Yet still so many people do it. I can only attribute this to stupidity and ego. People dumb and brazen enough to think they can do better than the open source community, people who have not studied the current tools available and prefer to play this children's game. Immature children writing and architecting supposedly mature software.</p>
<p>I've seen it over and over and I think it's time this needs to stop. These "engineers" and "architects" need to be called out and held accountable for the shit they have created. The abominations they have brought into the world. In a lot of cases, they themselves do not wish to program or use the "framework" or "library" they have created, but still claim that it is "better than anything else out there." The engineers who have to work in this garbage are stuck with it because product and business people do not realize the problem.</p>
<p>It's time for companies to realize the technical debt they are incurring by allowing these retarded rogue developers to roam free. If not now, it will be too late by the time it comes to the attention of the business people that their app is no longer maintainable, no one (employee or potential employee) wants to work on the garbage that was once the "magnificent" idea of some moron, and no big company wants to buy out their startup because any worth it may have conceptually had would be in the technology which is proven to be abhorrent to the buyer after a code audit.</p>
<p>If philosophies and perceptions are not changed now, it is likely there won't be a chance later.</p>
<p><strong>refactor($perceptions, $philosophies, $code) or die;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
