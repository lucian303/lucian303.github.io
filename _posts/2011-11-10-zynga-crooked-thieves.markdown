<p>To follow up on my article ("<a title="Options and shares: still nothing more than monopoly money" href="http://lucianux.com/2011/04/30/options-shares-still-nothing-more-than-monopoly-mone/" target="_blank">Options and shares: still nothing more than monopoly money</a>")&nbsp;decrying shares being offered to employees sometimes as the only form of compensation, other times to diminish real compensation (think $$$), here's news from <major_sarcasm>favorite tech company, Zynga</major_sarcasm>. They basically asked certain employees to give up their unvested shares or be fired. So much for contracts and contract law when it comes to a giant, incompetent company that slaves their workers wanting to get richer off their IPO at the expense of their employees.</p>
<p>Yet another reason shares/options are bullshit. Actually, they're worth less. Bullshit at least&nbsp;fertilizes&nbsp;soil.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Another interesting article:</p>
<p>'"I know you had a higher salary in mind, but Zynga's really going places. We're offering you some shares in the company that will be incredibly valuable once we go public. I don't want to make any promises, but when Google went public in 2004, more than 900 of its employees instantly became millionaires! So this is a potentially wealth-creating opportunity."'</p>
