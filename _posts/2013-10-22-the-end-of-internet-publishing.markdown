<p>Over the past few months, I've been deleting my unused accounts and data all over the Internet for obvious reasons on my own and with the help of such sites as:&nbsp;<a title="Just Delete Me" href="http://justdelete.me/" target="_blank">http://justdelete.me/</a></p>
<p>It is sad for me to see the death of Internet publishing. Now I do not mean that Internet content will cease to be created altogether. Rather, many of us have realized the liability of creating such content especially when it expresses unpopular opinions. Whether it be a blog, comment, social network, or random sites, the benefits that most Internet (almost exclusively but not completely web based) services offer are huge, yet they are not worth compromising one's self and data simply for their benefits, things that can be achieved in other ways (if not so conveniently) and have been.</p>
<p>I personally wish I could disconnect more accounts, but for professional reasons and admittedly, convenience reasons, Google is an especially tough one to get untangled of. At some point it may become necessary as well.</p>
<p>Nothing digital is private or secure. It's sad to have reached this point, but we have actually been here for years, in limited extents over a decade. Is this the new communism: an oligarchy of companies, inseparable from the governmental entities that allow them existence, with total information awareness at last?</p>
