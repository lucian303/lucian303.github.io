<p>Technology companies and other looking for software engineers will have you believe that there is a shortage of good engineers. Until a couple of months ago, I actually believed this too until I realized there is actually a surplus, not a shortage. The problem is not that there are no good engineers, but that companies don't know how to hire them or hire them quickly enough. On the few occasions that a good engineer is matched up with a fitting job, the recruiting and staffing that is done either by the company itself, or worse, through an outside agency usually ends up in disaster. The recruiters, staffers, and HR move so slowly that one wonders if they are even doing their job.</p>
<p>Especially in an area like San Francisco and the Valley, time is of the essence. With the average rent for an apartment in San Francisco being well into the $3000 range at this point, companies who move slowly should not wonder why they can't hire good engineers. No one is going to wait around for HR or recruiters to conduct their stupid, useless calls, to talk to a hiring manager, and then maybe come in for an in-person interview a month later. That's $3000 later just for rent, let alone food and other basic costs of living.</p>
<p>Then there is the undiscovered and forgotten talent. Engineers who are sharp as a whip and yet are not hired because they don't know a certain technology, usually some library or framework that can be picked up in a matter of days if not hours. This is purely despicable, but considering that most people have no idea how to hire a qualified engineer, it's not surprising. Even with Google ditching its stupid questions (the "Who will win a fight between 12 midgets and a bear?" type--and yes, that'a a real one I got, although not at Google), people still think they can tell how an engineer thinks by asking such idiotic banter or asking for implementations of algorithms that are best left to first year computer science majors whose ability stops there, rather than starting at the practical.</p>
<p>There is the rampant discrimination that just makes me sick. "Where are you from?" is a question that is asked in the ghettos of America (and undoubtedly all over the world), a confrontational question that usually leads to a fight or even killing if the person is not "from around here." <strong>It is also illegal to ask, as it is discriminatory, codified in&nbsp;Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</strong> Yet I, and others who have been born elsewhere have to suffer this indignation time and time again, many times losing jobs simply because we were not born in the US, because we have an accent, and because the interviewer is too stupid and unqualified to interview anyone.</p>
<p>Worse still is the exorbitant sexism in the industry. This needs no explanation if you've ever worked in the industry or even just peeked into an engineering department, but the accounts I have heard from women about their interviews are enraging and border on the perverse. It's no wonder that women might want to steer clear of this profession. Even when they are hired, the sexism and harassment does not stop in many cases. Not to mention the unequal pay.</p>
<p>So is there a shortage of qualified engineers? Hardly. There is a shortage, however, of people qualified to hire and a surplus of idiots who can talk the talk but have never walked the walk. Next time, consider why it takes you more than an hour to know if you're talking to a bullshitter or a qualified engineer. There are great engineers out there who simply should not interview others as they have no idea how to do so, no idea that an interview should be a conversation between peers, not idiotic puzzles, or worse, whiteboard coding of useless algorithms. If you can't tell a good engineer after a 45-60 minute conversation, you shouldn't be part of the hiring process. Period. Same goes if you don't know how to follow anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>If you're part of the hiring process, ask yourself what makes you qualified to be part of it. I've seen way too many interviews being conducted without the interviewers even having read the interviewee's resume, reading it on the fly. That's not only disrespectful, it's a waste of time for the interviewee as he or she has essentially already been discounted. If you're doing this, you obviously don't need another engineer that badly. Ask yourself what are you getting from asking idiotic questions or seeing yet another version of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself, as most people just don't have what it takes to recognize a good engineer if Steve Wozniak walked into their room. Take yourself out of the process and get someone who can handle it. Just because you can code, doesn't mean you can interview. The combination is rare. Finally, stop this HR madness and get straight to an in-person interview, or better yet, a short contract-to-hire or real assignment (to be paid at the actual market rates that engineer would get for any contract). Don't ask engineers to work for free and then wonder why they're walking out on your interview or hanging up on your call. And don't forget, it's important that you interview for the right position, the one the interviewee applied for. Sounds like common sense, but since there is no common, there is no common sense.</p>
<p>With so many qualified (and unqualified) engineers out there, there is no excuse for not finding a good engineer. Find someone who can learn things quickly. They will be more valuable than an engineer who is specialized in a library that will be obsolete in a year or less.</p>
<p>And please, stop with the sexism and discrimination. This is just disgusting in an already sick and disgusting culture of software and startups, where a salaried employee is expected to slave as long as his master ... oops, I mean employer ... wants him or her to. 24/7? Even indentured servants got breaks. But that's a topic for another day: the 24/7 on-call engineer, and why he/she is not making more for complete slavery. A wage slave is still a slave. At least afford them a sensical and speedy process. After all, a good engineer will always find work. The employer is the one who ends up losing most, then complains and we get stupid articles about shortages of good engineers and how hard it is to evaluate a good engineer. Most times, the employer and interviewers don't even know what they missed, they are so clueless.</p>
