<p>That is the question that came in my mailbox in the latest O'Reilly Code Newsletter. I've been thinking about this for months, so I felt compelled to answer and expound here:</p>
<p>Absolutely! There is no question that such a glass ceiling exists.</p>
<p>Many have blogged about this, and in reality the ceiling almost always exists and is hit early on in life by all good engineers who want to stay technical (usually in the mid to late 20's or early 30's). At the Senior Engineer / Architect level, two positions that are now, and have been for quite awhile, merging with the adoption of agile methodologies especially in web development, there is no more room for carrer advancement inside an organization or even by leaving the organization in most cases.</p>
<p>That is the glass ceiling.</p>
<p>There is nowhere to move up to that is technical. Above you are Directors, the VP of Engineering and the CTO, none of which are particularly technical, except certain CTOs in a limited and quite disconnected capacity. Mainly, those are all management positions and they, of course, pay more because in American corporate and societal culture (if the latter actually exists, I have yet to see manifestations of it or its difference from corporate culture), those who manage or "execute" (usually by doing and contributing essentially nothing of value as executives or managers) are way more valued than those who create and build the actual product without which those managers and executives would have no jobs, power, or money. Not even food.</p>
<p>To restate a popular saying properly: "Those who can do, those who can't, manage."</p>
<p>Welcome to the world and America in particular!</p>
<p>Do not confuse an entire industry's glass&nbsp;ceiling&nbsp;and lack of allowance of carrer advancement for the technical with room for personal learning and skill growth. Those opportunities are rare at most stages past the junior to mid level (where they are essential skills to keep one's job), mostly because learning is a process companies actively discourage through the use of ridiculous deadlines, unnecessary technical debt taken on (and justification thereof), and the resulting horrific software and code that results from a group of idiots getting together with a stupid idea that has no business potential and selling their lives and souls away almost literally to the venture capitalists and "angel" (what a misnomer) investors that are more than willing to take all from the sadly clueless in exchange for funding, essentially the worst loan one can possibly get (comparable to Mafia loans and just as destructive if not more so to the company as well as its employees (CEO, COO, CFO usually being the exceptions). Oops, sorry, I got off on a sidetrack there, describing 99.999% of the startups these days, especially in the City and Valley.</p>
<p>The last possibility is a company with an R&amp;D or science department that allows the brilliant technical people to excel, or rarely, a company with a structure that is not sacrificially competitive (see Michel O'Church's excellent post on this: <a title="Competing to excel vs. competing to suffer" href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/competing-to-excel-vs-competing-to-suffer/ " target="_blank">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/competing-to-excel-vs-competing-to-suffer/</a> ). This is extremely rare and much more a matter of luck and sacrifice (usually in compensation) on the part of the hardcore techies to do something that will keep that hunger for tech alive, or at least, keep them sane enough to still hope that they will find such a place where their skills can be put to real use, where they can get real job satisfaction, and where they can create quality products to solve real problems in a business environment that has a growth strategy, not an exit strategy. Unless your "exit strategy" is an I.P.O. (which is not an exit strategy, FYI), selling out as an exit strategy by the executives is akin to high treason by the President of the United States, all Supreme Court Justices, and all members of the Senate/House all at once! (Now let's not let this political simile degrade into political bantering here).</p>
<p>This glass ceiling is what poisons companies and leads to poor to mediocre work at best, rushed products, horrific code, frustrated employees, and high turnover rates. The best employees see this and leave, hoping against hope that the next place won't be the same. Yet knowing better. They try again and the same situation happens. They do contracting, but it's hardly ever fulfilling when one's barely making enough money to pay all the additional costs that the world's superpower should be ashamed of passing onto its unvalued citizens (healthcare, retirement, protection from crime, etc.) and still make decent money. Not to mention as a contractor, there is not much career advancement or technological advancement because most projects are of the "rescue the application because we hired a bunch of outsourced morons from the other side of the&nbsp;world&nbsp;and spent all our millions paying them to create something unintelligible and&nbsp;unusable"&nbsp;type.</p>
<p>At some point, many if not most, finally give up, get a relatively secure position and just work for the paycheck. By becoming "Losers" they become winners (see The Gervais Principle: <a title="Gervais Principle" href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/</a>). But many still lose something: the hunger and passion that drove them to strive to such high levels in the first place.</p>
<p>In the end, because of the corporate structuring and politics that create the glass ceiling, everybody loses. The only winners are the cartel-like organizations of venture capital firms, angel groups such as Y-Combinator, and angels.</p>
<p>Lucifer was also an angel.</p>
<p>If this isn't a glass ceiling, I don't know what is.</p>
