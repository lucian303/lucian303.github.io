<p>Recently, I've come across a slew of companies that are offering as a perk "unlimited" or "untracked" vacation. Mostly arising from unscrupulous startups, this is listed as a perk, a benefit of working there and something that would make employment at the company great because you can "take time off whenever you want for as long as you want to recharge."</p>
<p>Or some other such nonsense.</p>
<p>Do people actually fall for this ploy? Having seen some of the contracts these companies sign, in the vacation section, there is just vague wording that there are no set vacation days and the policy is left up to the discretion of the manager and the company.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't get vacation. Period. <strong>Legally (and practically), that's what such claims translate to: NO Vacation.</strong> It's plainly written in the employment contract that one signs before working for these companies.</p>
<p>Sure you might be able to <strong>beg</strong> your boss for time off and if he or she likes you, deems you worthy of time off, doesn't have much work for you, and is in a good mood that day, you might even be granted it. Or not. Regardless, you have no legal right to your vacation, thus no right at all as no company will give you benefits they are not legally entitled to. You have no right to any accrued vacation either because vacation does not accrue.</p>
<p>Under standard labor law (which varies in different states), employees have a right to accrue vacation as they work <strong>if such an option is provided by the employer</strong>. Note, that the US is the only one of the top 21 rich countries that does not require employers to give any vacation or paid holidays in the first place (<a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/no-vacation-nation-2013">http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/no-vacation-nation-2013</a>). This is what allows these unscrupulous companies to offer no vacation in the guise of unlimited vacation.</p>
<p>In many states like California, an employee has the right to his or her unused vacation pay when the employment relationship terminates, regardless of how it terminates. An employee can use vacation days for long illnesses before having to go on disability. An employee can take vacation days every year as dictated by policy, not by the whim of a manager (though manager approval is still necessary, denial of all vacation would breach the contract and employment laws). Many companies even allow accrual of vacation across years so that employees can choose to save some days for the following year, for a longer vacation such as seeing family half-way across the world (ever tried asking your unlimited vacation company for a month, let alone more and was it successful?).</p>
<p>Why does this matter? This is listed as a <em>perk</em>, something to be coveted, a breakthrough from corporate policies, but <strong>is nothing more than another way for companies, especially startups, to steal even more money from their employees while manipulating the employees into thinking this is to their benefit</strong>. Clever psychology.</p>
<p>It's not bad enough that salaried employees are required to give their whole life essentially to the job or risk being fired (as long as your wage stays above minimum wage, your employer can ask you to work as many hours a day as he or she wants and your refusal is immediate grounds for dismissal), but now employees are required to give up their earned vacation days. Vacation being one of only two benefits, along with health/dental/vision insurance for the lucky who work at companies that offer insurance, that is available before retirement that is worth any money (shares and options are worthless lottery tickets with a lesser chance of winning, see: <a href="http://lucianux.com/2011/04/30/options-shares-still-nothing-more-than-monopoly-mone/">http://lucianux.com/2011/04/30/options-shares-still-nothing-more-than-monopoly-mone/</a>), is something to be valued.</p>
<p>This ploy is yet another way for "scrappy" (read "cheap") and well-funded (read "cheap") startups (as well as established companies in some cases) with rich founders and investors to milk the most out of their overworked, burnt out, depressed, and sick employees while claiming it to be in the best interest of the employees.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of getting unlimited vacation, one gets no vacation, and when one needs that vacation to take time off, because of being overworked, illness, disability, or just to go on vacation (what a novel idea!), that time is not guaranteed.</strong> Especially in California and its sick startup culture that now pervades every part of the world, &nbsp;it is another affront to the crumbling, unenforced labor laws both at the state and federal level that were fought for with blood and paid for in lives.</p>
<p>True unlimited or untracked vacation would work something like this: I come in on the first day, sign the paperwork, and take 364 days of vacation. See you next year when we repeat the cycle. That's an endless loop anyone can get behind.</p>
<p>Unless you have the sweet deal above (and many high level execs, VC's, politicians, etc. do) you do not have unlimited vacation. You have no vacation and your employer is counting on you to ask for as little as possible. If that fails, they will fall back on their authoritative rule and absolute power over your vacation that you have willfully given to them in the pursuit of a chimera.</p>
<p>Do you really want to give up your vacation for a delusion that is too good to be true?</p>
